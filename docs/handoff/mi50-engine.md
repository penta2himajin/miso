## Snapshot

- Branch: `ai-written/m1-gguf` (PR open against `main`)
- Last work commit: `18c39da` @ 2026-09-25
- Working tree: clean after the handoff commit
- Last session: 2026-09-25 22:25 JST

## Status

ready-for-review (M1 first half: GGUF reader + CPU dequant; `ctest --preset default` 3/3 green)

## Next action

After the M1a PR is merged, branch `ai-written/m1-golden` from `main` and build the golden-output harness (ADR_001 D6, ADR_002 D11): a pinned Python env with `transformers` (qwen3_5_moe) + CPU `torch`, fed dequantised GGUF tensors, writing per-layer inputs/outputs for one DeltaNet layer, one full-attention layer and one MoE block.

## Verification

- M1a (this branch): `ctest --preset default` passes; `build/tests/test_gguf` reports 6 test cases, 0 skipped (the 753-tensor model comparison runs when the GGUF is present).
- M1 exit: golden files exist for one layer of each type and are reproducible from a script.

## Context pointers

- Hardware facts: `docs/research/mi50.md` (§1 summary, §5 measurements, §8 implications)
- Model file facts: `docs/research/ornith-q4km-gguf.md`
- Decisions: `docs/decisions/ADR_001-engine-foundations.md`, `docs/decisions/ADR_002-build-scope-numerics-ops.md`
- Baseline to beat: llama.cpp 57.2 tok/s tg64, 921.5 tok/s pp512 (`/home/penta/llm-mi50/NOTES-ubuntu.md`)
- Input GGUF: `/home/penta/llm-mi50/models/ornith-1.5-35b-a3b/Ornith-1.5-35B-Q4_K_M.gguf` (SHA256 `42739874…d41f`)
- Local llama.cpp with `gguf-py` and `llama-quantize`: `/home/penta/llm-mi50/src/llama.cpp` (`d81aef1`, build in `build-hip/`)

## Decisions made

See ADR_001 (D1–D6), ADR_002 (D7–D13), ADR_003 (D14–D19). Pending by measurement: activation format A/B (ADR_002 D9, at M2); pure-Q4_K weight file (ADR_002 D9, evaluated per ADR_003 D18 in parallel with M2).

## Failed approaches

- First cache-sweep microbenchmark: grid stride was a multiple of 2^18, so windows ≤256 KiB re-read one address per thread and overstated L1/L2 bandwidth. Fixed by per-block streaming (`bench/mi50/microbench.hip` `k_sweep`).
- `hipcc` without flags fails with `'cmath' file not found`: clang picks GCC 12 but only `libstdc++-11-dev` is installed. Use `--gcc-install-dir=/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/11`.

- CMake 3.22 "Unix Makefiles" with HIP sources: the legacy dependency scanner resolved `#include "axpy.hpp"` only relative to `tests/`, so editing a kernel header did not rebuild the test and a deliberately broken kernel still "passed". Ninja (compiler depfiles) is now required and the Makefile generator is rejected in `CMakeLists.txt`.
- Agent shell `cd` persists between commands: a `cd /tmp` in one probe made the next download land in `/tmp/third_party`. Use absolute paths or `( cd … )` subshells.
- A persistent shell running `set -e` exited on the first failing command and killed the agent shell session. Run throwaway tests in a `( … )` subshell instead.

## Session log

- 2026-09-25: Measured MI50 (`docs/research/mi50.md`), inventoried the Q4_K_M GGUF, recorded ADR_001 (language, kernels, prefill/decode split, decode execution, weight source, verification) and ADR_002 (build/test, scope, numerics, tokenizer/API, reference weights, benchmarks, repo ops). Found no published all-Q4_K Ornith GGUF; a pure file can be made with `llama-quantize --pure` from the BF16 GGUF (+13% decode floor, lower precision). Created the public GitHub remote and moved handoff to `docs/handoff/`.
- 2026-09-25 (later): Recorded ADR_003 (decode-first milestones M0–M5, source layout, clang-format 18.1.8 via pre-commit + pre-push check, no CI, Q8_0-based KL evaluation, `ai-written/<topic>` branches with PRs). Added the hooks, reformatted `bench/`, filled the project sections of `AGENTS.md`. Opened the PR from `ai-written/adr-003-tooling` (merged as #1).
- 2026-09-25 (M0): Built the scaffold on `ai-written/m0-scaffold`: CMake Ninja preset with GCC auto-detection, vendored doctest 2.4.12, `miso_kernels`/`miso_host` include boundary, post-build kernel resource report from code-object metadata, smoke operator `axpy` in the `__device__` op + thin wrapper pattern. Tests green; a mutation of `axpy_op` is caught (999 failed assertions). Found and fixed stale HIP header dependencies under the Makefile generator. Merged as #2.
- 2026-09-25 (M1a): On `ai-written/m1-gguf`, added the mmap GGUF v3 reader and F32/F16/BF16/Q4_K/Q6_K CPU dequantisation, bit-exact with gguf-py on real model blocks; the C++ tensor table matches gguf-py for all 753 tensors. A Q4_K scale-index mutation is caught. Allowing FMA contraction did not change results, because Q4_K products (11-bit d × 6-bit scale × 4-bit q) are exact in FP32; `-ffp-contract=off` stays as a guard for other formats.
